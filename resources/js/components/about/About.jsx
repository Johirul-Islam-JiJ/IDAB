                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    The Interior Designers Association of Bangladesh (IDAB) is
                    the national institute representing the interior design
                    profession in Bangladesh.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In the early 1900’s, the term “Interior Decorator” was first
                    used in America. Most decorators at the time had no academic
                    credentials, but the best of them had a combination of good
                    taste, common senses, and natural talent to interpret and
                    address the issues, such as scale and proportion. Elsie de
                    Wolfe became the first Interior Decorator to be given a
                    design “commission.” In 1913, Elsie de Wolfe published the
                    first interior design book, “The House in Good Taste.”
                    Dorothy Draper was the first documented commercial Interior
                    Decorator, establishing her design firm in 1923.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The term “Interior Designer” was coined in the 1930’s, by a
                    magazine called “Interior Design and Decoration.” That
                    magazine was not printed between 1943 and 1952, but a
                    competing magazine, “Interiors,” insisted on using only the
                    term “interior designer,” not “decorator.” At this time
                    design schools also recognized the work not only of
                    designers but also of architects and engineers. “Interiors”
                    published more contract work than residential work. When
                    “Interior Design and Decoration” magazine resumed
                    publication, it dropped the term “and Decoration” from its
                    name In 1995, Berger Bangladesh Limited started an Interior
                    design School in Bangladesh with Exterior-Interior Pvt
                    Limited (Ex-In, India) which follow a some several interior
                    design school in Bangladesh. Shanto-Mariam University of
                    Creative Technology introduced Interior Architecture
                    education in Bangladesh through establishing Interior
                    Architecture Department in the year 2003. Since then, the
                    department has been serving the nation with excellence in
                    Interior Architecture education. Now there are more than
                    3000 Interior designers who work with their creativity to
                    make a beautiful Bangladesh every day. For This number of
                    Interior designers founded IDAB with their passion,
                    dedication in 2020 which is now under the process for
                    Bangladesh Govt. registration.
